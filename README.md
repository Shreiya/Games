##Wee Wee Piggy

###OVERVIEW
Inspired by http://pr-if.org/play/lostpig/, Wee Wee Piggy is a satirical interactive version of the nursery
rhyme "This little piggy".
As the name suggests, the motive of the game is for the fifth piggy to get home safely. On his way, he encounters a number of surprises and we make it a point to keep him entertained with messages.
